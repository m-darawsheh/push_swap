# 🔃 push_swap - 42 School Sorting Algorithm Project

`push_swap` is a 42 School algorithm project that challenges you to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations and the smallest number of moves possible.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Sort a list of integers using two stacks and a limited set of operations.
- **Input**: Unsorted integers as command-line arguments.
- **Output**: A list of operations that, when performed on the initial stack, sort the numbers.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design efficient algorithms for sorting under constrained operations.
- Implement custom data structures (linked lists or arrays).
- Optimize to reduce operation count.

## 🛠️ Allowed Operations

- `sa`, `sb`, `ss`: swap the first two elements of a stack.
- `pa`, `pb`: push the top element from one stack to the other.
- `ra`, `rb`, `rr`: rotate (shift up) a stack.
- `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`: reverse rotate (shift down) a stack.

HOW USE 
make 
./push_swap  here nubmers spreated by spaces

=> example 
./push_swap 324 11 0 -2 34

and result will be the correct operations to sort the numbers
